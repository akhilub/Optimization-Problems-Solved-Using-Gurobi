During the Second World War the Royal Air Force (RAF) had many foreign pilots speaking different languages
and more or less trained on flying the different types of aircraft. The RAF had to form pilot/co-pilot
pairs (crews) for every plane with a compatible language and a sufficiently good knowledge of the aircraft
type. In the following table every pilot is characterized by a mark between 0 (worst) and 20 (best) for his
language skills and for his experience with different two-seat aircraft.

A valid flight crew consists of two pilots that both have each at least 10/20 for the same language and
10/20 on the same aircraft type.
