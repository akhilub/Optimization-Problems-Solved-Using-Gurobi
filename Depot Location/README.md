A large company wishes to open new depots to deliver to its sales centers. Every new set-up of a depot has
a fixed cost. Goods are delivered from a depot to the sales centers close to the site. Every delivery has a cost
that depends on the distance covered. The two sorts of cost are quite different: set-up costs are capital costs
which may usually be written off over several years, and transportation costs are operating costs.
There are 12 sites available for the construction of new depots and 12 sales centers need to receive
deliveries from these depots. The following table gives the costs (in thousand $) of satisfying the entire
demand of each customer (sales center) from a depot (not the unit costs). So, for instance, the cost per
unit of supplying customer 9 (who has a total demand of 30 tons according to the table) from depot 1 is $
60,000/30, i.e. $2,000. Certain deliveries that are impossible are marked with the infinity symbol.
