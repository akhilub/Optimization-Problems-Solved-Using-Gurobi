The airline SafeFlight uses the airport Roissy-Charles-de-Gaulle as a hub to minimize the number of flight
connections to European destinations. Six Fokker 100 airplanes of this airline from Bordeaux, Clermont-
Ferrand, Marseille, Nantes, Nice, and Toulouse are landing between 11am and 12:30pm. These aircraft
leave for Berlin, Bern, Brussels, London, Rome, and Vienna between 12:30 pm and 13:30 pm. The numbers
of passengers transferring from the incoming flights to one of the outgoing flights are listed in Table 11.1.

For example, if the flight incoming from Bordeaux continues on to Berlin, 35 passengers and their luggage
may stay on board during the stop at Paris. The flight from Nice arrives too late to be re-used
on the connection to Berlin, the same is true for the flight from Toulouse that cannot be used for the
destinations Berlin, Bern and Brussels (the corresponding entries in the table are marked with ‘–’).
How should the arriving planes be re-used for the departing flights to minimize the number of passengers
who have to change planes at Roissy?
