2. Install the Gurobi Optimizer following the instructions on their website: https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/quickstart_windows/installingthesoftware.html
3. Install the Python API for Gurobi by running the following command:

```
python -m pip install gurobipy
```

## Usage

Each problem is implemented in a separate Python file. To run a specific problem, navigate to the repository directory and execute the corresponding Python file:

```
python problem_file.py
```

The output will display the problem formulation, solution process, and the optimal solution (if found).

## Problems

The repository currently includes solutions for the following optimization problems:

- Knapsack Problem
- Traveling Salesman Problem
- Vehicle Routing Problem
- Facility Location Problem
- ... (add more problems as you implement them)

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have implemented solutions for additional optimization problems using Gurobi, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that your code follows the PEP 8 style guide and includes appropriate comments and documentation.
