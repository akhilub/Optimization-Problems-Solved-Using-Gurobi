Sunocoil is a company that commercializes five different types of petroleum products: gasoline of grades
80, 90, and 93, diesel, and engine oil. The company receives the products from its suppliers and stores them
in 9 tanks of different sizes. Sunocoil is expecting several orders from the suppliers to satisfy the demands
of the following month and requires to identify the best possible way of storing the products into its tanks.
Clearly, the products must be stored in the tanks without mixing them. In other words, only one type of
product can be stored in each tank, but several tanks may contain the same product. Suppose that Suncoil
is expecting 1,200 gallons, 700 gallons, and 1,000 gallons of gasoline of grades 80, 90, and 93, respectively;
450 gallons diesel; and 1,200 gallons engine lubricant. The sizes of the tanks are given in the following table.
Some of the tanks are already partially filled with a product.

You must identify what is the best possible way of filling the tanks in such a way that the number of
tanks used is minimized. Propose a formulation for this problem.
